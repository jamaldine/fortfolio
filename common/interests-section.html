            This allows you to work with the Ethereum blockchain, without the additional
            overhead of having to write your own integration code for the platform. The

          <p class="smartContract">A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the
            Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its
            state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart
            contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and
            they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled
            by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed.
            User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting
            transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart
            contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically
            enforce them via the code.</p>
